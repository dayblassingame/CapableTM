##Agile board task manager

This project utilizes ReactJS, Sass, and Semantic HTML and demonstrates how I am able to bring a simple feature to life during a two week sprint.

This feature allows users to create tasks with a name, description, and a due date. Once submitted a user can press the button with the forward arrows to move the task to the next stage or backwards to move the task to the previous stage. Users also have the option to delete tasks.


##HOW TO NAVIGATE THIS PROJECT

REQUIRES NODE INSTALLATION
1. run: npm install
2. run: npm start

##What did I learn
Creating this agile task board has advanced my knowledge of how to effectively manage state using hooks in react and then use state to conditionally render components.
