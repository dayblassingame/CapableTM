# CapableTM
Agile board task manager

This project utilizes ReactJS, Sass, and Semantic HTML and demonstrates how I am able to bring a feature to life from conception to completion during a two week sprint.

This feature allows users to create tasks with a name, description, and a due date. Once submitted a user can press the button with the forward arrows to move the task to the next stage or backwards to move the task to the previous stage. Users also have the option to delete tasks.
